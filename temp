      <p>
        It's been an incredible decade for me. So much of my life has changed in
        the last 10 years.
      </p>

      <p>
        The 2010's were the years that I was looking for opportunities to work
        with others. I had no idea how is working in a team. I was unaware of
        all the hard hours I had to deal with.
      </p>

      <p>
        At the same time I that was the year that I went through collage. At the
        same time, I had to study and work which was really hard for me - but
        with a lot of fun.
      </p>

      <p>
        Living and growing up in Iran is difficult by its nature. Add my
        confusion about the future and what I am going to do, to it, so it
        becomes a nightmare.
      </p>

      <p>
        It was not that important where I start my career. I just wanted to
        enter the real world.
      </p>

      <p>
        So in 2011's, I start my career by working on something called Adobe
        Flash. I know it is deprecated now. However that days it has a lot of
        fan.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        Adobe Flash is a multimedia software platform used for production of
        animations, rich internet applications, desktop applications, mobile
        apps, mobile games, and embedded web browser video players.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        For one year or so, I built multimedia for small companies that were
        trying to introduce themselves to the outside world.
      </p>

      <p>
        When I look at those experiences now, I am not sure whether that was a
        right choice or not. It was like a try-and-error thing for me.
      </p>

      <p>
        After a year of working on building multimedia, I found that there is
        something called <strong>ActionScript</strong>.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        ActionScript is an object-oriented programming language originally
        developed by Macromedia Inc.ActionScript is used primarily for the
        development of websites and software targeting the Adobe Flash platform,
        originally finding use on web pages in the form of embedded SWF files.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        I had no programming experiences until then. After a few weeks of
        struggling with ActionScript, learning essential concept of programming
        ( if-else, for-loops, function, class ) I was able to write a simple
        script. That was a really big step for me.
      </p>

      <p>
        By the end of 2012's, I knew I am going to code for the rest of my life.
        It was a win for me, because I finally had a decision.
      </p>

      <p>
        For me, it was a new start with a lot of new challenges. I knew I had to
        work hard because learning materials at that time were so minimal and
        hard to access - especially if you were in Iran!
      </p>

      <p>
        So after a year of dealing with fundamentals of programming I finally
        had a chance to work in a company as a Javascript developer. At the end
        of 2013's, I had a job which I got paid for it. At the same time I was a
        student of software engineering.
      </p>

      <p>
        I live in Isfahan. My first official job was working in team of 8
        developers. I was the only javascript developer at that team. I
        implemented a windows like application that was working on the browser.
        It has start menu, dialogs, alerts, confirms, setting, context menu and
        a lot of other stuff.
      </p>
      {/* TODO: talk about khorasgan university  */}
      <p>
        The very first browser I met and working on was Internet Explorer 5.
        Developing javascript applications was a big deal because of the lack of
        developer tools of IE5.
      </p>

      <p>
        I learned a lot of things. I had a great chance to work with experienced
        developers. I found a lot of friends. I learned a lot of soft skills. It
        was a great two years of working until 2015.
      </p>

      <p>
        So I left the company and migrated to Tehran. I was faced with a lot of
        new opportunities. After a few weeks of looking for a new job, I finally
        found a company called{" "}
        <a href="https://persiabme.ir/" target="_blank">
          PersiaBME
        </a>
        .{/* TODO: write a few lines here, knockout-js  */}
      </p>

      <p>
        Tehran is a tough place to live and work. Especially if you live alone.
        So after about one year of moving between Isfahan and Tehran, I left the
        company and came back to Isfahan.
      </p>

      <p>
        When I came back to Isfahan - around 2017's, a lot of things have been
        changed. That was the days when startups started to show up. Small
        companies were trying to popularize available ideas in Iran. They were
        looking for developers.
      </p>

      <p>
        I introduced with a buzz word, <strong>Frontend Development</strong>.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        Front-end web development is the development of the graphical user
        interface of a website, through the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, so
        that users can view and interact with that website.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        Basically, it is <u>JavaScript + CSS + HTML</u>. Not a new thing, but
        with a more fancy name. So I tried to replan my learning path and step
        forward in a way to become a frontend developer.
      </p>

      <p>First thing I was looking for, was a roadmap to follow.</p>

      <p>
        <a href="https://roadmap.sh/frontend" target="_blank">
          developer-roadmap
        </a>{" "}
        was a popular thing those days. It had a few basic roadmap, now it is
        updated and cover a variety range of roadmap for different tech stacks.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the early 2018's I started working for a startup called Tutti. We
        were a small team of 4. I was the only developer there at the starting
        days. I was working on a traditional client-server web application.
        Backend was written with{" "}
        <a href="https://about.magento.com/Magento-Commerce" target="_blank">
          magento
        </a>{" "}
        and frontend was pure javascript. We had a team in Poland I guess that
        were working on the backend development.
      </p>

      <p>
        It was my first experience of working in a startup. It was great. I
        worked with nice guys, learned a lot of things and tried to be a better
        developer.
      </p>

      <p>Unfortunately, after one year Tutti died! and I had to move again.</p>

      {/* TODO: write about Yashar */}

      <p>So I had a vibe to build my own business. In the</p>
