In our experience at SQUER Solutions, micro-frontends are useful when scaling frontend development in large teams and improving resilience and time-to-market issues. We’ve experimented with various approaches, from simple linked applications to advanced client-side integration using web components. However, implementing micro-frontends comes with challenges like maintaining design consistency, which requires a strong design system, and handling distributed system issues like performance and latency, which we mitigated with techniques such as a shared caching layer. Starting with a monolith-first approach is often wise until the domain is well understood for proper frontend splitting.

The developer experience in micro-frontend projects heavily relies on a solid CI/CD pipeline, as much of the complexity shifts to the build-and-deployment process. Performance and design consistency are valid concerns with micro-frontends, but they can be addressed by moving integration to the client and using a mature design system. Ultimately, micro-frontends should only be embraced if the benefits, like independent deployments and scalability, outweigh the downsides for the specific use case. Starting with a monolith and evolving from there is a good strategy for most teams.

<h3>What is your experience with micro-frontends?</h3>

When consulting with our customers, we always stress that microservices
are about end-to-end verticals that enable independent deployments of
autonomous parts of an application at a high pace. Following this idea, it
was clear from the very beginning that we had to somehow make this
possibility on the frontend parts of these architectures as well. We
experimented in a dozen projects with different approaches, including
simple ones, like linked applications, but also more sophisticated ideas, like
the integration on the client side with web components.

<h3>
  What benefits and pitfalls did you encounter in your journey with
  micro-frontends?
</h3>

One big lesson was the impact on the look and feel of huge frontend
applications. Thus, a micro-frontend architecture must go hand in hand with
a strong understanding and maturity in design systems. In addition, you also
have to deal with the classical issues of distributed systems, like
performance and latency. For example, over the years we discovered that a
shared caching layer on the frontend is a good idea; it was a game changer
for how we designed our micro-frontend architectures. And last but not
least, it’s nearly always a wise decision to start with a monolith-first
approach.

<h3>
  Did you contribute to any OSS project related to microfrontends? If so, which
  one?
</h3>

Unfortunately, I have not actively contributed to one of them so far, mainly
because we almost never use off-the-shelf frameworks for our microfrontend architectures. We try to keep the dependencies small and stuck to
basic web standards, like web components, to build micro-frontends.

<h3>
  When would you suggest using micro-frontends, and when should we avoid them?
</h3>

It’s really hard to answer this question without any further context, but I
think it is important that, as with every new architecture or technology,
micro-frontends should not be an end in itself. Still, in our experience at
SQUER Solutions, it shows its benefits mainly when the team size gets too
big to work on one codebase in the frontend, when resilience issues start to
erase, or when the time to market is below expectations.

<h3>
  At the end of your last micro-frontend project, what worked and what didn’t?
</h3>

I think we started to have the maturity that allowed us to spot the right
points where the frontend should be split up. But especially for client-side
integration, it’s a daily challenge to let the integration module of your
micro-frontend architecture not sprawl too big and become a bottleneck.

<h3>
  What are the must-have tools for developers to have an efficient experience
  with micro-frontends?
</h3>

In most cases, the concept of monorepo makes a lot of sense: a single repo
for all the micro-frontend projects, especially to share and ensure
consistency for commonly used UI components. Besides this, each module
that is used inside the micro-frontend architecture should, of course, strictly
follow semantic versioning, and the team should have a common
understanding about breaking changes.

<h3>
  What would you suggest for a person who wants to embrace this architecture?
</h3>

As mentioned before, start with a monolith-first approach. Only start to use
micro-frontends once you understand the domain well enough to split them
up reasonably

<h3>
  What was the impact of introducing micro-frontends to developers who didn’t
  know about them? What challenges have you faced?
</h3>

I have seen similarities to the introduction of microservices a few years ago,
which makes total sense, as in both cases distributed architectures are
introduced. The new challenges are therefore to design micro-frontends to
be backward compatible and to enforce asynchronous over synchronous
communication.

<h3>What was the developer experience like in your last project?</h3>

I think a solid CI/CD pipeline is essential. In a micro-fronted architecture,
most of the complexity moves from a developer’s machine to the build-anddeployment process. Thus, a feature in such an architecture is delivered
once it’s deployed to production, not once it’s committed to the versioncontrol system. All the tooling should support and align with this thinking.

<h3>
  Many developers are concerned about performance and design consistency with
  micro-frontends. What are your suggestions for overcoming these challenges?
</h3>

Basically, it can be said that these concerns are absolutely justified. The
question should be whether other advantages of micro-frontends outweigh
these problems for a specific use case. My rule of thumb for performance is
the more we strive for performance in a micro-frontend architecture, the
more we must move the integration to the client. For design consistency, a
mature design system can usually overcome most of the challenges.

<h3>What are the first steps for working with microfrontends?</h3>

Don’t be too opinionated, search for diverse resources that will help you
make decisions. In addition, conference talks are a good source for
practitioners’ reports and learning from the mistakes others have already
made.

<h3>
  Would you like to share some useful resources about micro-frontends?
</h3>

As mentioned before, I usually like to listen and learn from the experiences
of others; conference videos on YouTube are a good way to get those
insights. In addition, the micro-frontend introduction on [Martin Fowler’s
blog](https://martinfowler.com/) is a good jump start to this topic. Well, and of course, the book readers
are holding in their hands!

<h3>Micro-frontends in three words...</h3>

Go for it!
