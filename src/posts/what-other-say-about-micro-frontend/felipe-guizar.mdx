This developer's experience with micro-frontends centers on migrating existing websites rather than greenfield projects. They adopted micro-frontends to allow gradual migration and integration of new features, rather than overhauling entire platforms at once. The main benefit observed is the ability to keep frontend technologies up to date with developers' expertise, which aids in hiring and retention. However, the architecture adds complexity in managing different pipelines, versioning, and handling authentication.

Key challenges include defining micro-frontend boundaries based on business subdomains, integrating them effectively, and handling authentication. A CLI tool, like the one developed in the Ara Framework, was essential for simplifying the developer experience. While micro-frontends offer flexibility, it's important to define clear boundaries to avoid performance issues and ensure design consistency through reusable components and atomic design systems. This architecture should only be pursued if the challenges align with the business needs.

<h3>What is your experience with micro-frontends?</h3>

I haven’t yet had the opportunity to implement micro-frontends in a
greenfield project. However, I’ve worked on several projects that migrated
websites to new technologies.

On those projects, we agreed that migrating from scratch was not a good
business approach because we can’t deliver new features until we finish the
migration. Instead, we decided to look for an approach to gradually migrate
the websites and set the basis for integrating new features easily,
introducing micro-frontends to our solutions.

<h3>
  What benefits and pitfalls did you encounter in your journey with
  micro-frontends?
</h3>

<h5>Context</h5>

Frontend technologies (FE) evolve very fast. For instance, I’ve seen
companies that started developing their applications using old
frameworks/libraries (AngularJS, BackboneJS) years ago. At some point,
new frameworks were introduced in the FE world (React, VueJs), and then
developers started learning and choosing those as their main tech stack.
For those companies, it’s difficult to keep developers engaged and hire
developers who are glad to maintain applications using old technologies.

<h5>Benefits</h5>

Micro-frontends help to evolve applications along with the technologies.
However, it’s not only about bringing the application up to date in terms of
technology; it’s also about aligning the company tech stack with the
developer’s expertise.

<h5>Pitfalls</h5>

This architecture adds more complexity for managing different pipelines,
versioning and integrating the micro-frontends in the host application.
Additionally, managing authentication is one of the trickier parts.

<h3>
  Did you contribute to any OSS project related to microfrontends? If so, which
  one?
</h3>

Yes, I’m the creator of Ara Framework.
Ara Framework makes developing micro-frontends easier by integrating
any view library (React, VueJS, Svelte) on any web technology/framework,
such as NuxtJS, GatsbyJS, WordPress, Flask, and more.

<h3>
  When would you suggest using micro-frontends, and when should we avoid them?
</h3>

I believe having good knowledge of the business domains is necessary to
identify each micro-frontend’s boundaries; otherwise, it leads to bad
abstractions that can introduce more complexity for integrating and
communicating them.

<h3>
  At the end of your last micro-frontend project, what worked and what didn’t?
</h3>

Server-side includes using a proxy server work well for integrating
nonauthenticated micro-frontends in non-JavaScript frameworks. This
approach helps us to migrate partial views from WordPress to React along
with the content necessary to render those views.

In the early days of the project, we tried to use authenticated microfrontends using server-side rendering through the SSL proxy server (Nova
Proxy). We faced issues forwarding the authentication header, but we
realized we could just render those views from the client side using a kind
of client-side include (Nova Bridge). Here are a few relevant resources:

https://ara-framework.github.io/website/docs/nova-bridge

Also, centralizing the SSL proxy server created the main point of failure.
We tackled it by using the server as a sidecar proxy.

<h3>
  What are the must-have tools for developers to have an efficient experience
  with micro-frontends?
</h3>

A command-line interface (CLI) for scaffolding, running services locally,
and easily deploying micro-frontends.

For example, Ara Framework has a CLI to create new micro-frontends for
different view libraries, and commands to run Nova Proxy and Nova
Cluster locally.

<h3>
  What would you suggest for a person who wants to embrace this architecture?
</h3>

Evaluate the problems you’re trying to solve against the challenges you’ll
face implementing this architecture.

<h3>
  What was the impact of introducing micro-frontends to developers who didn’t
  know about them? What challenges have you faced?
</h3>

It encouraged developers to be more involved in the business side,
promoting a common language that improves communication. It also
encouraged developers to be more involved in making architectural
decisions.

However, when micro-frontends were announced in 2019 in the
ThoughtWorks Radar as an “adopt technique” in the social networks, there
were some misunderstandings about the main goal of micro-frontends. It’s
still challenging to introduce the architecture to developers biased by those
comments.

<h3>What was the developer experience like in your last project?</h3>

As I mentioned before, a CLI tool significantly improves the developer
experiences. However, we needed to extend the Ara CLI to automate
deployments and provisioning infrastructure necessary to run the
application.

<h3>
  Many developers are concerned about performance and design consistency with
  micro-frontends. What are your suggestions for overcoming these challenges?
</h3>

I believe performance issues related to loading several micro-frontend
views on the same page is a sign that micro-frontend boundaries are not
well defined. A user flow can involve several subdomains, but the user only
interacts with one at a time. For example, when a user navigates to the
product listing page (product subdomain) and chooses a product, they
finally go to the payment page (payment subdomain).

I recommend lazy-loading each micro-frontend entry point based on routing
(routes usually represent a subdomain involved in a user flow).

Obviously, there are cases when we have several subdomains on the same
page. For example, in an article page, we have the content itself (content
subdomain) and the comments and rating section (content feedback
subdomain). Users mainly view an article to read the content. Microfrontends give us the flexibility to server-side render the content and make
it available as soon the user opens the page, and we can let the browser
client-side render the other sections on demand (lazy-loading based on
scrolling).

Regarding design consistency, I suggest using design systems with reusable
components that are domain agnostic. Atomic design is a good
methodology for implementing design systems in micro-frontends.

<h3>What are the first steps for working with microfrontends?</h3>

Define the micro-frontends’ boundaries based on the business subdomains,
and identify subdomains that interact together in the user flows.

<h3>
  Can you share the main thing to avoid when working with micro-frontends?
</h3>

Avoid thinking of micro-frontends as components we can deploy and
integrate independently (we can use Module Federation instead). Microfrontends are views that represent a business subdomain.

<h3>
  What are the main challenges in embracing this architecture from your
  perspective?
</h3>

Identifying the business subdomains and defining the micro-frontend
boundaries.

Looking for an approach to aggregate them in the host application.
Handling authentication and authorization.
