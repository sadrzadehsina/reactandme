This developer's experience with micro-frontends (MFEs) began at CanopyTax, where multiple squads worked autonomously using the single-spa framework. They highlight the benefits of MFEs, such as team independence, shared infrastructure for consistent updates, lazy-loading for improved performance, and a better developer experience with smaller bundles and faster load times. However, they caution against assuming MFEs are a silver bullet, noting potential challenges like occasional widespread updates, CSS conflicts, and the overhead of maintaining shared infrastructure. Despite these, the overall experience with MFEs has been positive, especially in supporting gradual migration and integration of legacy systems without major rewrites.

They also note that while MFEs are great for large teams with strong infrastructure, smaller teams may find the architecture overkill. A key lesson from their experience is to avoid the complexity of supporting multiple frameworks unless necessary, and to focus on cohesive, low-coupled MFEs. They also recommend sticking to one framework whenever possible to reduce performance issues. The developer experience has been overwhelmingly positive, with faster build times and easier maintenance, but requires openness to learning new infrastructure like CI/CD pipelines and module bundling tools.

<h3>What is your experience with micro-frontends?</h3>

I was introduced to micro-frontends (MFEs) when I joined CanopyTax,
which is the company where Joel Denning and Bret Little (the creators of
single-spa and related tools) worked. It was an amazing transition to be in a
place where anywhere from 6 to 12—depending on the situation—squads
were able to work autonomously. (Squads is a term that was taken from the
Spotify model, but essentially they’re full teams that are centered around a
feature instead of being organized by role.)

I left Canopy because another company was interested in setting single-spa
up for two reasons: 1) to enable future growth and scale, and 2) to help
gradually sunset their legacy application and write new code, while running
both side by side. I like to think we were successful at both, and the
company was later acquired.

I think that was one of the first implementations of single-spa that used
SystemJS 3.0 with import maps, so it was fun to see how these new
standards greatly simplified the infrastructure required for single-spa. That
infrastructure would also later help form the foundation for single-spa’s
“recommended setup.”

My current company is currently investigating using single-spa because it
acquired a company that built a tool in a different frontend framework than
the one we use, and we would like to potentially integrate the two without
having to do a major rewrite of either.

<h3>
  What benefits and pitfalls did you encounter in your journey with
  micro-frontends?
</h3>

You’ve heard this a thousand times, but MFEs aren’t a silver bullet. That
being said, they have some great pros and a couple of cons to be aware of.

Here are the pros:

* Team/squad independence. No release trains, code freezes, merge
conflicts, long-lived feature branches, QA frustration with testing
environments changing/not changing, etc.

* A shared infrastructure that means that everyone is always on the
latest version of a library. For example, designers love it because
changes to your style guide go out instantly to the whole app.

* A (variable) amount of freedom to experiment and let the best
technologies rise out of those experiments, instead of being stuck
on the legacy technology because of either the fear of trying
something and it failing or not wanting to rework your whole app.

* Lazy-loading built-in, which means a better and faster user
experience.

* Bundle sizes and speeds comparable to a monolithic app. There’s a
misconception that MFEs are significantly bigger and slower than
a monolith, and that’s simply not true.

* Ability to seamlessly combine legacy software with new software
and to integrate software that may have come through an
acquisition with in-house software.

* An amazing developer experience. You only have to run a single
MFE locally at a time, while all the others can just run their
production code. Nearly every single developer that I’ve worked
with has mentioned how much better the DX is for them over a
monolithic setup.

* For single-spa at least, it’s based on web standards: ES modules,
import maps, etc.

* Teams that are focused on vertical slices of the app translate into
teams that are specialized and know their feature set really well.

* However, there are some cons as well:

* On rare occasions, you will need to do an update on all your MFEs,
which is a monotonous task.

* The shared infrastructure can be a double-edged sword. For
example, it’s great to have your style guide update for everyone at
the same time, until you accidentally break something and now it’s
broken everywhere.

* This is minor, but you need to ensure that your CSS is scoped so
that one MFE’s CSS doesn’t conflict with another’s.

* The infrastructure takes a bit more work than just building a
monolith. However, to put it into perspective, in my experience,
the vast majority (~90%) of DevOp’s time was spent working on
the backend’s microservices infrastructure.

<h3>
  Did you contribute to any OSS project related to microfrontends? If so, which
  one?
</h3>

I’m a core-team member of single-spa, so I’ve worked on the library itself
as well as the documentation, browser plug-in, example repos, and so on,
and I am active in the Slack channel. I’ve been a participant in other
projects related to MFEs, namely SystemJS, the Import Map specification,
and webpack’s Module Federation plug-in.

<h3>
  When would you suggest using micro-frontends, and when should we avoid them?
</h3>

I generally don’t recommend them for small teams of one to five
developers. That being said, there are still situations where that can make
sense. Beyond that, it really comes down to how comfortable (or willing to
learn) you are with frontend architecture, such as CI/CD pipelines and
webpack/rollup configurations.

<h3>
  At the end of your last micro-frontend project, what worked and what didn’t?
</h3>

Almost everything went well, except for one thing: the decision to support
multiple frameworks by using web components. In practice, that turned into
everyone still only using one framework, but at the cost of additional time
and overhead to support web components instead of using framework-
specific components. My recommendation is to stick to just one framework
when at all possible.

<h3>
  What are the must-have tools for developers to have an efficient experience
  with micro-frontends?
</h3>

With single-spa, it’s really just about getting the infrastructure up and
running; after that, the tools used on a day-to-day basis are exactly the same
as a monolith. For the infrastructure, you need to understand import maps
and webpack/rollup configuration and have a way to scope your CSS. It’s
also important to understand coupling and cohesion and how they relate to
microservices. You want MFEs that are highly cohesive and have low
coupling in order to succeed.

<h3>
  What would you suggest for a person who wants to embrace this architecture?
</h3>

Ask yourself for what purpose do you want this infrastructure? If you’re
doing it because you’re a small team but you want independent deploys, it
may not be worth the effort.

<h3>
  What was the impact of introducing micro-frontends to developers who didn’t
  know about them? What challenges have you faced?
</h3>

When I’ve had genuine conversations with developers about it, they
generally are open to the idea but don’t know how to set it all up in practice.
After helping them out, they’re almost always excited about it all and love
it.

I’ve had conversations with people who are very hesitant about certain
aspects (e.g., “the infrastructure is difficult” or “what about consistent
styles?”), and the conversations generally go well, even if they still decide
to not implement them. That’s OK! Not everyone is up to the task of
spending a couple days to work on infrastructure, but at least some
misconceptions were dispelled.

And then there’s been conversations with people who are completely
unwilling to listen and just want to make memes about MFEs. In those
situations, there hasn’t been much I could say that would help them
understand.

<h3>What was the developer experience like in your last project?</h3>

Excellent. There are open source tools for doing MFE overrides with
single-spa, so that makes working on an MFE easy. Additionally, running
only a portion of your whole app locally means that when you hit the save
button, webpack takes only a fraction of a second to update instead of
multiple seconds to recompile.

<h3>
  Many developers are concerned about performance and design consistency with
  micro-frontends. What are your suggestions for overcoming these challenges?
</h3>

Regarding performance, you mainly just need to put constraints on your
team, such as saying, “We’ll only support Vue, not any other framework.”
Just doing that will take care of 90% of your performance issues; the other
10% is no different than taking care of performance for a monolith.

As far as design consistency goes, that’s actually a straw man put up by
people who haven’t used modern MFEs. You’ll find that your designs will
actually be more consistent when you only have to deploy your style guide
once and it’s updated for all apps everywhere, instead of needing to npm
install your style guide in each app.

<h3>What are the first steps for working with microfrontends?</h3>

Go to one of the example websites that exist for single-spa and set up an
override for one MFE. Try it out and see what you like and don’t like. Then
find us on GitHub, Twitter, or on Slack and ask questions.

<h3>
  Can you share the main thing to avoid when working with micro-frontends?
</h3>

Just because you can have multiple frameworks doesn’t mean you should.
It’s still recommended to try and stick to one framework if at all possible.

<h3>
  What are the main challenges in embracing this architecture from your
  perspective?
</h3>

Your willingness to be open to new ideas and to work on infrastructure such
as CI/CD pipelines and webpack/rollup. You also need to understand when
you should create a new MFE versus adding to an existing one.

<h3>Would you like to share some useful resources about micro-frontends?</h3>

We try to keep the single-spa website up to date. Also, the single-spa Slack
channel is open to anyone, and we frequently talk about tech-related things
besides single-spa in the #randomstuff channel. The book Building
Microservices is a good reference, even though it’s very backend focused.

<h3>Micro-frontends in three words...</h3>

Enables team independence.
